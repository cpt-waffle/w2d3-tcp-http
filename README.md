#### W2D3 - Networking with TCP + HTTP

Thanks for sitting through todays lecture!
First part of the leture we talked about networking.

#### Networking

We talked first what is networking in general.

Networking is communication. When two people try to network they communicate.
We also should set of rules on a person comunicates, sot that both people aren't shouting on each other (or another wor for this is `Protocol`).

- Person A says something to Person B
- Person B listens to what person A has to say
- When person A finished, Person B can start talking

##### Communcation Between Computers

For computers its almost the same thing.

First, computers communicate between a medium.

Types of medium:

 - wire
 - wifi
 - radio

 Second, we can set some rules ( restrictions ) on the said medium.

 - can send a message only when the key 'y' is pressed
 - every odd number order computer gets a message in lowercase
 - every even number gets a message in binary


#### TCP - (Transport Control Protocol)
TCP - A set of rules that two machines agreed to abide by to communicate with each other.
The protocol that allows us to transfer data, but only when we are connected.

##### Rules

*AS LONG AS YOU HAVE A CONNECTION.........*

Client can send messages
Client can recive messages
Server can broadcast a message to all clients
Server can recive client messages

Better way to think about this
`IP` - is a road between computers
`TCP` - trucks with information that are going towards a computer to dump off the data

#### DEMO - Basic Chat Server

We will build a chat server using `tcp`.
We will be using a built in node module called `net`.

The client connects to the server, and once the connection has been established the client can send messages to the server, which in turn, once the server recieves it, it will broadcast that same message to all of the connected clients.
We will use `stdin` to let the client write any message they want.

### Client (Basic)

```js
const net = require('net');
const stdin = process.stdin;
//We need to specify the address and the port to connect to
const client = net.createConnection({
  host: 'localhost',
  port: 3000
});
//We need the encoding to tell the server and the client what kind of data are we transfering
client.setEncoding('utf8');
//When I, the client finally connect...........
client.on('connect', function() {
  client.write('I have connected!!!');
})
```

#### Server (Basic)

```js
const net = require('net');
const stdin = process.stdin;

const server = net.createServer();
// when someone connects................
server.on('connection', function(conn) {
  //Set encoding just like on the client
  conn.setEncoding('utf8');
  //when one of the connections sends data and we recieve it.............
  conn.on('data', function(data) {
    console.log("connected user says:", data);
  })
  console.log("someone has connected");
})

server.listen(3000)
````

First code we started with was just how to connect the client and the server. Then we added a basic way to send a message once a client connects.

Then we added a way for the client to type using `stdin` and send that message to the server which it gets and `broadcasts`back to everyone else (see `server.js` and `client.js`)

#### HTTP - (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol, aka - rules (or protocol) on top of TCP)

We also talked at the very end of the lecture about HTTP. We talked about how the client requests some page from the server.

The client gives a `TYPE` of a request method

- GET - READ data from the server
- POST - SEND data and CREATE an object on the server
- PUT/PATCH - SEND data and UPDATE an object on the server
- DELETE - DELETE data on the server

The client also sends a `route` to the server on which method should event should run for that route

- GET `www.reddit.com/r/dogs` - Hey reddit, please give me the page for the subreddit `dogs`

- GET `https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B00STSZ77G/` - Hey amazon give me the desciption for product number `B00STSZ77G`

Once the server receives and process the request, it send back a response which contains the following:

*Response Status*

Contains a response code and a message
Response codes are divided in series
- 100 series = informational
- 200 series = ok
- 300 series = redirection
- 400 series = client error
- 401 unauthorized
- 403 forbidden
- 404 not found
- 500 series = server error

Response headers - which information that is being returned.

and finally the...

Response Body - the content that the client requested. (usually HTML or JSON)

We will be talking alooooooooot more about *HTTP* and you will be using it for the remaineder of bootcamp so be patient and dont get overwhelmed with the info above :)
